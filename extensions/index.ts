/**
 * pi-glm-tweaks — Pi-native tweaks for Z.AI's GLM coding models
 * (glm-5.2, glm-5.3, glm-5.3[1m]).
 *
 * Restricts the Pi thinking-level UI to the modes each GLM model actually
 * supports, wires the native `thinkingFormat: "zai"` wire
 * translation, auto-clamps hidden levels, and applies token-efficiency
 * hygiene (per-turn system-prompt nudge, wire-level
 * clear_thinking and skip-short-thinking).
 *
 * Wire map (see https://docs.z.ai/guides/capabilities/thinking and
 * providers/openai-completions.js in pi-ai):
 *
 *   glm-5.2 (thinking can be disabled):
 *     Pi level  | thinking.type | reasoning_effort
 *     ----------|---------------|------------------
 *     off       | "disabled"    | (omitted)
 *     high      | "enabled"     | "high"
 *     max       | "enabled"     | "max"
 *
 *   glm-5.3 / glm-5.3[1m] (thinking always on; thinking.type:"disabled"
 *   removed in 5.3 — direct API rejects it; migration is enabled +
 *   reasoning_effort "low"):
 *     Pi level  | thinking.type | reasoning_effort
 *     ----------|---------------|------------------
 *     off       | "enabled"     | "low"   (enforced by the request-layer
 *     low       | "enabled"     | "low"    guard below, NOT the map — Pi's
 *     high      | "enabled"     | "high"   zai transport sends "disabled"
 *     max       | "enabled"     | "max"    whenever effort is undefined)
 *
 * The top tier is Pi's native `max` level, NOT `xhigh`: z.ai names its wire
 * value "max" (docs.z.ai/guides/llm/glm-5.3), Pi ships a matching `max`
 * level, and showing `xhigh` for wire "max" misnames the mode in the UI.
 * `xhigh` is hidden like the other non-wire levels below.
 *
 * Hidden levels are Pi-side concepts that don't map cleanly to the wire
 * (5.2: low/medium map server-side to "high", minimal is a no-op for Pi's
 * reasoning transport; 5.3: minimal/medium have no wire counterpart;
 * both: xhigh has no distinct wire tier under max).
 * Showing them invites accidental footguns.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - On session_start, re-register the `zai` provider with every targeted
 *     GLM model redefined against the OpenAI-compat endpoint and its tight
 *     thinkingLevelMap. registerProvider takes effect immediately after
 *     bindCore (no /reload).
 *   - On model_select to a targeted zai model, clamp a stale hidden level
 *     to a supported one and notify. Set the footer status hint.
 *   - On model_select to any other model, clear the footer status.
 *   - On every user turn, inject a soft system-prompt budget fragment
 *     (`glm-budget-nudge`, default OFF — cache-safe but not behavior-
 *     neutral; see FLAGS below).
 *   - Per LLM call, count cumulative reasoning_content; if over a
 *     threshold, inject a one-shot user-side hint to push the model back
 *     toward tool calls (`glm-budget-nudge`).
 *   - On every outgoing request, force `clear_thinking: true`
 *     (`glm-clear-thinking`, default OFF). The coding endpoint ships Preserved
 *     Thinking ON by default precisely to maximize cache hit rates (see
 *     z.ai Thinking Mode docs); forcing it off re-bills the full prefix
 *     every turn.
 *   - On short user prompts (<80 chars), use the lightest thinking mode
 *     to save tokens on trivial turns (`glm-skip-short-thinking`, default
 *     OFF — toggling request shape turn-to-turn reduces cache hits).
 *     glm-5.2: thinking.type="disabled"; glm-5.3: thinking stays enabled
 *     with reasoning_effort="low" (5.3 rejects "disabled").
 *
 * Auth is untouched. The provider's existing key (ZAI_API_KEY env, /login,
 * or models.json apiKey) continues to resolve against the new baseUrl.

	// Messages) — only while a TARGETED GLM model is selected; the chip is
	// cleared for every other model (non-GLM providers and untargeted zai
	// entries like glm-4.7, which keep their own baseUrl — showing a route
	// there would be misleading). Display only — the authoritative
	// per-request decision reads ctx.model.api, so a stale chip can mislead
	// but never miswire.
	//
	// Set from TWO hooks, not just model_select: pi's interactive mode calls
	// resetExtensionUI() (which CLEARS all extension footer statuses) on
	// /reload, /new, and /resume — and model_select does not re-fire after
	// those when the model is unchanged, so chips set only there vanished
	// until the next manual model switch. session_start fires after every
	// reload/session switch, making the pair cover all transitions:
	//   - session_start: startup, /new, /resume, /reload (incl. the
	//     /glm-tweaks toggle/route reload itself).
	//   - model_select: model switches, incl. restore; also the clear path
	//     for non-targeted models.
